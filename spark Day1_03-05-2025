[10:06 AM, 5/3/2025] Sai Aditya Number Save it please: Hive  Performance Tuning

Partitions

Proper File formats (Parquet file format)



Engine Change 

set hive.execution.engine = tez  (before)

InMemory Computation


Parallel Execution --- By Enabling it-- process gets faster

set   hive.exec.parallel=true







Vectorization

By default vectorization is false

Enable it below property

set hive.vectorized.execution.enabled = true;

By Default -- Hive would process 1 Row at a time

But By enabling vectorization -- Hive would process 1024 Rows at a time


Mapside Join  in Hive ===== (Broadcast Join in spark)

sql layer on HDFS

Back end engine --- MAPREDUCE

It runs on HDFS

DATAWAREHOUSE ON HDFS

E L T PURPOSE

QUERY TIME PARSING

STRUCTURED AND SEMI STRUCTURED

EVERY THING YOU DO HIVE-- IMPACT HDFS AT THE BACKEND

CREATE DATABASE- CREATE TABLE IMPACT HIVE WAREHOUSE

YOU CAN LOAD DATA FROM EDGE NODE-

	load data local inpath '' into table tablename;

You can also create table on existing directory

	create table tablename ()  location '';

Types of tables in Hive ---


	Managed----If you drop table --- deletes back end directory
	External---If you drop table --- does not delete back end dir


Partitions ---- Speed up the Process
		Static Load partitions
		Static insert Partitions
		Dynamic Partitions


Hive Cloud analytics
		Hive is same but in cloud we can also create tables on CLOUD STORAGES(S3,BLOBS,CLOUD STORAGE)

AVRO Supports  schema Evolution --- Every avro file will columns inside it --- it gets matched with Hive columns
